# DeeLeMa (Deep Learning for Mass estimation)
We present a deep learning network for building an optimal searching for events with missing kinematic information at the colliders. Our network can be usefully
used for precise measurement of the standard model or to find new physics beyond the standard model in events involving neutrino or dark matter. To be specific, we reconstruct the invisible momenta in t Ì„t-like antler event topology and reconstruct the particle mass spectrum of the event only with the decay topology information. We show our deep learning network named as DeeLeMa can powerfully improve the reconstructing not only mass but also momentum.
