# DeeLeMa (Deep Learning for Mass estimation)
We present DeeLeMa, a deep learning network to analyze energies and momenta in particle collisions at high energy colliders, especially DeeLeMa is constructed based on symmetric event topology, and the generated mass distributions show robust peaks at the physical masses after the combinatoric uncertainties, and detector smearing effects are taken into account. DeeLeMa can be widely used in different event topologies by adopting the corresponding kinematic symmetries.
